      <div>
        <strong>Leave a Voicemail</strong> - Automatically leave a clear, context-aware message for the patient to know the purpose of the call.

        <strong>Smart Scheduled Callbacks</strong> - Set specific dates and times for future attempts (e.g., tomorrow at 3 PM)

## Phone Number Management

Mira can assign specific phone numbers to enhance patient trust and regional presence with advanced phone number capabilities. 

- **Local Area Codes**: Match your patients' locations with region-specific numbers
- **Custom Phone Numbers**: Use dedicated numbers for your patient's consistency
- **Telephony Integration (Beta)**: Connect with your existing phone system (custom integration available depending on your provider)

## Human Agent Elevation

Mira includes sophisticated sentiment monitoring and seamless human handoff capabilities:

<Note>
Mira successfully handles 99% of patient interactions! However, we understand that sometimes human intervention is needed.
</Note>

### Automatic Elevation Triggers
- **Negative Sentiment Detection**: Mira monitors patient sentiment in real-time
- **Direct Requests**: Immediate handoff when patients ask for a representative

<Warning>
When a call is elevated to a human agent, all context, including the conversation history and patient information, is transferred seamlessly.
</Warning>

## Coming Soon: Advanced Workflows

<Info>
We're working on multi-step workflow capabilities! [Let us know](mailto:support@miramace.com) if you're interested in early access.

### Example: Insurance Claim Follow-up
1. Call patient to verify appointment completion
2. If confirmed, automatically contact insurance provider

These advanced workflows will enable complex scenarios requiring multiple calls to different stakeholders, ensuring smooth coordination and follow-through.
